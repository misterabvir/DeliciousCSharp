# Funny CSHARP

it's hard to imagine how many times I checked this or that feature in #sharp, well, I tested it, drove it back and forth and deleted it so that it wouldn't hurt my eyes. something stuck in my head, but not all. now this repository is intended to store all the nonsense that I dare to code at my leisure as a fun or another experiment.
